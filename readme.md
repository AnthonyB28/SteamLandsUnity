**Description**

This starter kit is a simple game that you can download, play with and submit to the store – both to Windows Store and Windows Phone Store. It contains the basic functionality of a 2d side scrolling shooter game. This game starts simple, then after level 3 – more enemies will come, and after level 4 there is a possibility that a harder enemy that takes two shots to kill will spawn. The game supports input of touch, mouse, keyboard and the xbox controller. This game is pretty simple, but with your modifications to it, it can be a totally new game with much more content.

**What can I do?**

You can open the project using the free or pro version of Unity, modify the game by adding more enemies, bosses, weapons, power ups, character attributes so when you level up you can get more strength, shoot quicker, move quicker, add a world map, create levels with different landscapes, add two-player, make it 3d – it’s all up to you, and it’s really simple using Unity!
